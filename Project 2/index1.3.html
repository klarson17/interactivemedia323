</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;stumbling,</br>
</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;around in the dark.</br>
</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fighting,</br>

</br>
	Blinded,</br>
</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;reminded,</br>
</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of the fear inside.</br>
</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turning, </br>
</br>

	Soaking,</br>
</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;choking,</br>
</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; struggling to breathe.</br>
</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hiding,</br>

</br>
	Chasing</br>
</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;racing,</br>
</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I stagger away.</br>
</br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Breathless,</br>
